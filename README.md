### Desert Botanical Garden (DBG) has conducted an annual Saguaro Inventory since 2012. Now that 8 years of data have been collected, DBG is curious to find out if there are any patterns or trends in the data, particularly with respect to weather. We focused this analysis on two main questions. 1. Is there a relationship between saguaro mortality and number of nights above 90 degrees. Cactus cannot "breathe" when the night-time temperature stays above 90, so we would expect to see a trend. 2. Is there a relationship between saguaro growth rate and precipitation. We would expect to see years with higher precipitation produce higher growth rates in the following year.
